If two bags get too close, pass along the first one a bit faster if possible.\n\nAccidentally have two bags at the same time? Please wait a week before passing along the last one!\n\nPs: the order of the bags is by date! This way you can easily see which ones are slacking."

You can always try something and add it to the next bag when you do not like it!\n\nMake sure that everyone shares the responsibility for good quality items. Do you see anything that shouldn’t be in the Loop, for example it has stains or holes? Take it out and donate it to a clothing container. This way, it can still be used for someone or something else. If in doubt, ask the person next to you if he/she agrees and decide then.\n\nAnd last but not least, set a good example yourself; share some nice photos and encourage others to do the same."

    "content": "Welke dingen kan ik aan de tas toevoegen?\n\nPlease only add clothing that is ready for a new owner. Be mindful of stains, holes, or other obvious signs of wear. (If you discard of it because it looks worn, someone else will probably not take it either. Better bring those items to your local recycling.) If the bag is full, please wait for the next one to add your clothes!\n\nSizewise: mixed bags usually work well, as sizes vary per brand and proportions are different as well. But this only works within a certain width. We recommend having a mix of items from size 36 - 42 (Small Medium Large) and starting a new Clothing Loop for plus sizes.\n\nWhat not to add to the bag: underwear (unless new with tags), and items that are too bulky. You can try to find a new owner for them through theBulky Items section in this app!\n\nThere are no guarantees that you will find something that you like. But finding one dream item is more worth than having 10 items in your wardrobe that you don’t wear. And realize that you can make someone else very very happy and that this is part of the Clothing Loop mentality!"
