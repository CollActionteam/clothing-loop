# Email flow diagrams

## Delayed unregistered loop approval

```mermaid

flowchart
   Start(Start) --> A["Person (without an account) selects a loop from the map and clicks on join"]
   A --> B[Person fills in the the registration form and submits successfully]
   B --> C[/Many days later/]

   C -. If never registered .-> C3[Nothing happens]
   C3 --> D3(End)

   C --> D[Person logs in for the first time]
   D --> E[Email is sent to the loop host]

   C -- Meanwhile --> C2[Loop host does not receive an email]
   C2 --> D

   E --> End(End)

```

## Find abandoned loops

```mermaid

flowchart TD
   subgraph SB1[Loop is abandoned]
      SA[Someone has requested to join the loop] --> SB[/60 days later/]
      SB --> |Nothing happened| SC[Email is sent to all hosts reminding\nto accept or decline 'join requests']
      SC --> SD[/30 days later/]
      SD --> SE{A host has responded\nto a 'join request'}
      SE --> |True| S0[Loop is active]
      SE --> |False| SF{Host has not logged-in\nin the last 30 days}
      SF --> |True| S0
      SF --> |False| S1[Loop is abandoned]
   end
   Start(Start) --> SB1
   SB1 --> |Loop is abandoned| A[Loop is set to draft and closed]
   A --> B[/7 days later/]
   B --> C[Email is sent to all participants asking if they want to become host]
   C --> End(End)
```

## Email resend #578

Email resends happen on these templates:

- an_admin_approved_your_join_request.gohtml
- an_admin_denied_your_join_request.gohtml
- approve_reminder.gohtml
- poke.gohtml
- register_verification.gohtml
- someone_is_interested_in_joining_your_loop.gohtml

```mermaid
flowchart TD
   ST(Start) --> A
    A[Send email to user]--> B{sent status}
    B -->|Sent| B1[OK]
    B -->|Not sent| B2["Save email in database¹"]
    B2 --> C[/One day later/]
    C -->E{Has sent email\n3 times and failed}
    E --> |NO| D[Send email again]
    D --> B
    E --> F[Send error email to\nclothingloop.org]
    F --> End(End)
```

¹ The emails can be found in the database following the first send failure in the database table `mail_retries`.

## Delete loops

```mermaid
flowchart TD
   Start("Start ¹") --> A
   A[Loop is abandoned] --> B[/5 months later/]
   B --> C[Mail all participants that this abandoned loop will be deleted,\nasking if someone wants to take it over]
   C --- |And| D[Mail all hosts that this abandoned loop will be deleted]
   D --> E[/3 weeks later/]
   E --> F[Mail hosts that loop will be deleted shortly]
   F --> G[/3 weeks later/]
   G --> H[Delete loop]
   H --> End(End)
```
