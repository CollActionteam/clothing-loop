    question:
      "Are there rules on how much you can take out, and do you have to donate the same amount of clothes as you take out?",
    answer:
      "No, there are no rules here. Sometimes you take a bit more, sometimes you give more. Please don't add clothes to the bags that aren't of good quality, just to add something! It's better to have a bag half full of treasures, than to have a full bag that is of less quality.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can all sizes of clothing be in the same bag?",
    answer:
      "Mixed bags work perfectly well usually, as sizes vary per brand and proportions are different as well. But this only works within a certain width. We recommend having a mix of items from size 36 - 42 (S, M and L) and starting a new Clothing Loop for smaller or bigger sizes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How to avoid “Finders keepers, losers weepers”?",
    answer:
      "There are no guarantees that you will find something that you like. Sometimes a few bags will pass your house that may not have an item for you. But remember: finding one dream item is more worth than having 10 items in your wardrobe that you do not wear. And making someone else very happy with something that was collecting dust in your wardrobe is also a significant (and fun!) part of the Clothing Loop mentality!",

  {
    question:
      "What to do with bulky clothes (like winter coats) that don't fit in the bag?",
    answer:
      "Big items can be photographed and shared via the communication channel, or through the Glide app. In a private message, people can respond and organize pick up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I put shoes in the bag as well?",
    answer:
      "The short answer is yes, but keep in mind: shoes are more difficult to pass along than clothes. There are many more sizes, and they show wear a lot quicker than garments. So please be very selective with shoes! Only add “as good as new” pairs, and have no more than 2 pairs per bag.",
