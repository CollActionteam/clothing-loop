# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### Run the app in the development mode

This opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) automatically in your default browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any errors in the console.

`npm run start`

### Build the app for production to the `build` folder

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`npm run build`

### Lint

Tests using Prettier if the code is styled correctly.

`npm run lint:test`

Tries to fix any missing spaces or tabs required by Prettier

`npm run lint`
