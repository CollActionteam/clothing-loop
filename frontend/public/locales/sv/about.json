  "p1": "<p><strong>The Clothing Loop är ett initiativ som erbjuder ett enkelt sätt för människor att byta kläder med andra i sitt område.</strong> Det är roligt, gratis och hållbart! Tanken är enkel: (stora) väskor fyllda med kläder åker längs en rutt förbi alla deltagare i en viss stad eller stadsdel.</p><p>Fick du väskan ​från personen före dig i Loop? Nu är det dags att handla! Ta alla plagg du gillar och lägg i kläderna i väskan som är i gott skick och redo för en ny ägare. Dela gärna ett foto på ditt senaste fynd i motsvarande kommunikationskanal. Det är verkligen kul att se var de kläderna hamnar! Sedan tar du med dig väskan till nästa person på listan. ​Alla deltagare känner inte varandra, så det ökar verkligen känslan av gemenskap i grannskapet.</p>",

  "p2": "<p>This idea originated in Amsterdam during the first lockdown. <strong>It worked so well that soon other cities followed, and it snowballed throughout the Netherlands, and even across borders.</strong> By now there are hundreds of Loops. And not just in densely populated areas, the system works everywhere! With our guidance, support and community building efforts, this local initiative grew into the powerful movement it is today. <strong>Together we have saved thousands of kilos of clothing, neighbors have gotten to know each other, and we brought about a real change in behavior with regard to our textile consumption.</strong></p><p>Please join the movement! After all, if you buy only six items less than you normally would in a year, you save about <strong>40 kilos of CO2 emissions:</strong> the equivalent of driving one gasoline car from Amsterdam to Paris. Our goal is to reach 1 million swappers within the next 5 years. <strong>This saves as much CO2 emissions as driving that same car around the world 5,000 times.</strong> You are welcome to try it now: sign up and/or follow us on socials to decide later. We’d love to inspire you to stop shopping and start swapping! PS: Why do we use Ikea bags you ask? Because we first want to use stuff that already exists. And who hasn’t got an Ikea bag lying around the house? (By the way: any large shopper will do!)</p>",
