      "question": "Y a-t-il des règles concernant le nombre de vêtements que l'on peut prendre, et doit-on remettre la même quantité de vêtements que l'on prend ?",
      "answer": "Non, il n'y a pas de règles en la matière. Parfois vous prenez un peu plus, parfois vous donnerez plus. Veuillez ne pas ajouter des vêtements de mauvaise qualité dans les sacs, juste pour mettre quelque chose ! Il est préférable d'avoir un sac à moitié rempli de trésors que d'avoir un sac plein de vêtements de moindre qualité."
    },
    {
      "question": "Peut-on mettre toutes les tailles de vêtements dans le même sac ?",
      "answer": "Les sacs mixtes fonctionnent parfaitement bien en général, car les tailles peuvent varier selon les différentes marques et les proportions peuvent également varier. Cela ne fonctionne toutefois que dans une certaine mesure. Nous conseillons de mélanger les tailles 36 à 42 (S, M et L) et de créer un nouveau Loop pour les tailles plus petites ou plus grandes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Comment éviter de tomber dans le piège du regret ?",
      "answer": "There are no guarantees that you will find something that you like. Sometimes a few bags will pass your house that may not have an item for you. But remember: finding one dream item is more worth than having 10 items in your wardrobe that you do not wear. And making someone else very happy with something that was collecting dust in your wardrobe is also a significant (and fun!) part of the Clothing Loop mentality!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What to do with bulky clothes (like winter coats) that don't fit in the bag?",
      "answer": "Big items can be photographed and shared via the communication channel, or through the Glide app. In a private message, people can respond and organize pick up."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I put shoes in the bag as well?",
      "answer": "The short answer is yes, but keep in mind: shoes are more difficult to pass along than clothes. There are many more sizes, and they show wear a lot quicker than garments. So please be very selective with shoes! Only add “as good as new” pairs, and have no more than 2 pairs per bag."

    {
      "question": "How can I start using the app?",
      "answer": "You can copy the app and use it within your group. You only have to fill in the address list in our downloadable template. It is super easy! We created a video tutorial and slide deck to help you get started. Please get in touch here if you still run into trouble!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there graphic templates we can use?",
      "answer": "Absolutely, we made you a folder where you can find logo's templates, manuals and all. Use as many as you like!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Introducing a “Ghost rider” in the Loop",
      "answer": "Once your Loop is ongoing for a while, you may want to change things up a little bit! You can then introduce a “ghost rider” bag that travels in the other direction, so all of a sudden you have other people before you in the route, and also other styles in the bag. If you do so, please make people aware that they shouldn't put any items in the “ghost rider” bag that they have previously taken out of a regular bag. And keep the number of ghost rider bags limited to 1 or 2, to keep it special and also simple."
    },
    {
      "question": "How to manage a large group of people in the communication channel?",
      "answer": "Especially when groups get bigger, it is important to make sure people aren't bombarded with (irrelevant) messages. You can set up some rules for what should and shouldn't be shared via the group app. For example:<br /><br /><span>Yes,</span> in the app:<ul><li>Selfies of nice things you took from the bag or nice things that you are putting in</li><li>Compliments to others</li><li>Logistics and organizational relevant updates</li></ul><span>No,</span> not in the app:<ul><li>Everything unrelated to the Clothing Loop (requests for surveys, invites for new groups, Fund raising, memes, etc). If you want to ask everyone's input on something, use a polling app like LouLou instead</li></ul>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I no longer have time to manage the Clothing Loop I started?",
      "answer": "Use the group! Ask if someone else wants to take over and host the loop."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if someone wants to join but lives too far away?",
      "answer": "If someone signed up for your Loop but lives too far outside of your Loop area, it is up to you to decide if he/she/them may join. One thing you can do to decrease the distance between addresses, is to ask that person to find other participants between their area and the original Loop location."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an ideal group size?",
      "answer": "We'd recommend having a minimum of 20 people in a group: after 20 addresses you usually do not recognize anything in the bag anymore, so you can keep swapping. There is no real maximum, it is up to you what still works! In the Netherlands a loop is on average 45 people. But there are loops running smoothly with 130 people!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What to do if the Clothing Loop does not work well?",
      "answer": "If the quality of the clothing isn't high enough, people might leave the Loop. Make sure that everyone shares the responsibility for only adding good quality items.<br/><br/>Do you see anything that shouldn't be in the Loop? Take it out and donate it to a clothing container. This way, it can still be recycled. If in doubt, ask the person next to you if he/she agrees and decide then.<br/><br/>A fabric shaver can extend the lifetime of a clothing item enormously! You can share this advice within your community.<br/><br/>And last but not least, set a good example yourself; share some nice photos and encourage others to do the same!"
